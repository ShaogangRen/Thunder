===binary_dump_libsvm===
binary_dump_libsvm is a program that converts the libsvm dataset
into a binary file for fast loading of lassolver.
Usage: ./binary_dump_libsvm <n> <p> <input_libsvm_data> <output_binary_data>
Example: ./binary_dump_libsvm 16087 1668738 myfinance.libsvm myfinance.bin
Now we have myfinance.bin and Xy_sim_N_10000_p_2000000.bin ready to use.


Please read run_all.sh and batch.sh for more details.

===batch.sh===
In batch.sh you can specify a collection of epsilon, r1 and m1.
The script enumerates all those combinations for the experiment.
batch.sh takes two inputs as parameters---bin_file and lambda.
The bin_file is generated by binary_dump_libsvm. 

===run_all.sh===
run_all.sh simpliy specifies the two inputs mentioned above for batch.sh.

Example cmd:
 nohup sh  runall_finance.sh > nohup_finance &
